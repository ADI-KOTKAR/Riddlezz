The anxious husband told us that her wife hasn\u2019t been home since last night.\r\nOn searching the house, we found Carl's personal diary. Carl had a very abnormal handwriting which was difficult to understand.\r\nSuddenly we received a call from Hotel Caesars Palace and we were informed about a crime scene in their hotel. We reached the crime scene as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CAndrea was found dead in her hotel room. Before the incident, she and her husband(Carl) were undergoing divorce. \r\n\r\nIn the room, all the fingerprints had been eliminated with ammonia. The label of the ammonia bottle used to clear the evidence was found which linked to the pharmaceutical company that Carl owned. \r\n\r\nThere was a handwritten note which said, \"She deserved this.\" The handwriting belonged to Carl, but looked like it was forged. \r\nA piece of torn cloth was found which turned out to be Carl's. This was an indication that there had been a struggle, however, there was no other evidence to support this cause. \r\n\r\nFurther investigation revealed that Carl suffered feats of aggression and also proved his dyslexia. \r\n\r\nAndrea was a troubled woman and had attempted suicide in the past. Carl used to lash out by beating her. The police concluded that this was a case of suicide.\r\nWhat piece of evidence gave it away?\u201D\r\n",

Carl also stated that Andrea thought she was the only one Jorge Manley was involved with but later she found about his another affair and this might have forced Andrea to end this story right here.\r\nWe asked Carl whether he has any children?\r\nCarl said that he has a daughter named Olivia and is sleeping inside the bedroom.\r\nWe asked whether we could ask a few questions to her, to which she agreed.\r\nWhen he went inside to call Olivia, he screamed.\r\n\r\n“Carl’s 3 yrs old daughter Olivia, who was sleeping disappeared from the bedroom.
